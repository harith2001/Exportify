Introduction 
Sri Lanka is at a crucial moment in its history because of its severe economic crisis, which is caused by dwindling foreign exchange reserves. Our country has started a pioneering effort to address this crucial issue and open the door for economic recovery: the creation of the innovative platform and mobile application known as EXPORTIFY.
EXPORTIFY lies at the heart of this transformative effort, designed to empower small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across Sri Lanka. At its core, this platform provides these enterprises with a unique avenue to earn foreign currency, offering a dynamic marketplace where they can seamlessly sell bulk goods to consumers abroad. By doing so, EXPORTIFY aims to not only bolster economic growth but also enhance the resilience of the national economy.
